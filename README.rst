An extractor and manager for the TODO comment lines that are used in lines of code. In an attempt
to sort out TODO's in my own projects I created this tool which could be handy for others too.

Extractor
=========

Here goes an explanation of what the extractor part of the tool is.

Manager
=======

Here goes an explanation of what the manager part of the tool is.

Documentation
=============
For API documentation, usage and examples see files in the "docs"
directory.  The ".rst" files can be read in any text editor or being converted to
HTML or PDF using Sphinx_. An HTML version can be generated using ``tox -e docs``.
To view the docs use your favourite browser to open docs/_build/html/index.html

Installation
============
Package is created with ``poetry`` as the dependency and build system.


Run Tests
=========
For running tests 'py.test' is used. Standard commands are used.
